# DifferentialEvolution
# Generalized Python program to implement DE optimization  for single objective functions

Implemented and tested based on the Egg holder function and Holder table functions

1) R1, R2, R3 are randomly selected chromosomes from the pool for the mutant vectors (differ per generation)
2) K, F are relaxation factors
3) perform crossover 
4) check for elitist factors
